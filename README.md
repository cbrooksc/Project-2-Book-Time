# bookTime
Project 2 -  E library that allows you to rent books for a certain amount of time at no cost. 
Ideally this is an application that would be purchased by the public libraries systems, and would allow for their book inventory to be utilized by online readers.

Backend Craig Sequelize, Node, Mysql,routes

1.created the routes for the html pages
2.github administraton
3.build sequelize routes and modules for the library
4. seed mysql database and build mysql scheme

The function of mysql db in our app is to store the book library data while providing a system where I can create, insert, delete, and update my sequelize routes for the application. Sequelize is used to querying the DB based on the model used in node.js. The CRUD routes were create but we were unable to use them becuase their was not middleware Javascript/JQuery.

Project 2 - bookTime

Don Tillery:

My primary function was front end development. I put together the library.html first. The new technology that was used was masonry.js. This technology gave the page an offset grid type of look.

I also created the homepage. I used bootstrap for the majority of the page. I also used the carousel functionality of bootstrap which I may be considered a new technology.

With both of those pages, I created a majority of the .css styling with the help of Carina.

I created the .csv file and then, with Craig, got the data imported into the SQL database.

On the last night, because of complications and time restrictions, I attempted a portion of the middleware unsuccessfully.
